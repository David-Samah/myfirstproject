            I was born in Manchester , United Kingdom at a family of eight. My Dad worked at a local garage shop and my mother was a saleswoman.
            I had my passion with computers at an age of seven when I discovered a computer at a shop nearby. My parents were reluctant with my interest to learn computer
            but came to a point of agreement when my IT teacher told them the future that was waiting for me. They went to a computer shop and bought me a computer worth 400 pounds.
